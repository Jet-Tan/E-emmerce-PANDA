10 July 1856\\xa0– 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[2][3] engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[4]\\nBorn and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.\\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[5] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[6]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Early years\\nTesla\\'s rebuilt birth house (parish hall) and the church where his father served in Smiljan, Croatia. The site was made into a museum about him.[7]\\nNikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856.[8][9] His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879),[10] was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.[11][12][13][14] His father\\'s brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.[10]\\nTesla\\'s mother, Georgina \"Đuka\" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest,[15] had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother\\'s genetics and influence.[16][17]\\nTesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was aged six or seven.[18] In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla\\'s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac[19] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.[20][21] Later in his patent applications, before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as \\'of Smiljan, Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary\\'.[22]\\n\\nTesla\\'s father, Milutin, was an Orthodox priest in the village of Smiljan.\\nTesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.[a] Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this \"mysterious phenomena\" made him want \"to know more of this wonderful force\".[25] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[26] He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.[27]\\nAfter graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla\\'s father (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood),[28] promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.[29] Tesla later said that he had read Mark Twain\\'s earlier works while recovering from his illness.[30][31]\\nThe next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan[32] by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter\\'s garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. Tesla passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required[33]) and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\"[33] At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating.[30][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed][34] But by his third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla was not studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.[35]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"Tesla aged 23, c.\\u20091879\\nTesla's family did not hear from him after he left school.[36] There was a rumor among his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby river Mur but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor and reported that encounter to Tesla's family.[37] It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month.[35] In March 1879, Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home and take up his education in Prague.[37] Tesla returned to Gospić later that month when he was deported for not having a residence permit.[37] Tesla's father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness.[37] During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.\\nIn January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.[38][39]\\n\\nWorking at Budapest Telephone Exchange\\nTesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.[30][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n\\nWorking at Edison\\nIn 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[40] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.[41] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Moving to the United States\\nEdison Machine Works on Goerck Street, New York. Tesla found the change from cosmopolitan Europe to working at this shop, located among the tenements on Manhattan\\'s lower east side, a \"painful surprise\".[42]\\nIn 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well.[43] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated[44] and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.[45] As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators.[46] Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.[45] One of those times was noted in Tesla\\'s autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS\\xa0Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\".[42] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system.[47][48] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla\\'s designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.[49]\\nTesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.[45] What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.[47] Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.[50][51] In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but it turned out to be a practical joke\".[52][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed] Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"Tesla, you don\\'t understand our American humor\".[53][54] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay[b] and the company did not have that amount of cash (equal to $1,695,556 today) on hand.[56][57] Tesla\\'s diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good By to the Edison Machine Works\".[48][58]\\n\\nTesla Electric Light and Manufacturing\\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[59] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.[45] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.[59] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla\\'s name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.[60] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey.[61] Tesla\\'s new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.\\nThe investors showed little interest in Tesla\\'s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility.[62] They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla\\'s company and leaving the inventor penniless.[62] Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock.[62] He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery\".[62][c]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content=\"AC and the induction motor\\nDrawing from U.S. patent 381,968, illustrating the principle of Tesla's alternating current induction motor\\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck.[64] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.[65] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea,[66] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1⁄3 to Tesla, 1⁄3 to Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund development.[65] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.\\nIn 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).[67][68][69] This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.[70][71]\\nAlong with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent.[72] Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.[72][73] Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.[74][75]\\n\\nTesla's AC dynamo-electric machine (AC electric generator) in an 1888 U.S. patent 390,721\\nIn July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($67,800 in today's dollars[76]) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.[77]\\nDuring that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.[78][79]\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Market turmoil\\nTesla\\'s demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse\\'s subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies.[80][81] The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison.[82][83] Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla\\'s motor and the related polyphase system right away.[84]\\nTwo years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric.[85] The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract.[86][87] At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development.[84][85] Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty[88] even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer.[70][85] In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties.[89] The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract.[89][90] Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla\\'s patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).[91][92][93]\\n\\nNew York laboratories\\nMark Twain in Tesla\\'s South Fifth Avenue laboratory, 1894\\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests.[94] In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902).[95][96] Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.\\n\\nTesla coil\\nMain article: Tesla coil\\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz\\'s 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.[97] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.[98] Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.[99] He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.[100][101]\\n\\nCitizenship\\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[102][103] In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.[104]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Citizenship\\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[102][103] In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.[104]\\n\\nWireless lighting\\nTesla demonstrating wireless lighting by \"electrostatic induction\" during an 1891 lecture at Columbia College via two long Geissler tubes (similar to neon tubes) in his hands\\nAfter 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil.[105] He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage.[106] He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.[107]\\nIn 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting it through the Earth.[108][109]\\nTesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).[110]\\n\\nPolyphase system and the Columbian Exposition\\nA Westinghouse display of the \"Tesla Polyphase System\" at Chicago\\'s 1893 Columbian Exposition\\nBy the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla\\'s induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter.[111] Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\". They believed that Tesla\\'s patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.[112]\\nWestinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.[113][114][115]\\nA special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla\\'s induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.[116]\\nTesla visited the fair for a week during its six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit.[117][118] A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe;[119] these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.[120]\\nAn observer noted:\\n\\nWithin the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, \"where they produced so much wonder and astonishment\".[121]\\nSteam-powered oscillating generator\\nMain article: Tesla\\'s oscillator\\nDuring his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current.[122] Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.[123][124]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Consulting on Niagara\\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla\\'s opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla\\'s advice and Westinghouse\\'s demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.[125]\\n\\nThe Nikola Tesla Company\\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla\\'s lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.[126] It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla\\'s patents for decades to come.\\n\\nLab fire\\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla\\'s lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla\\'s 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla\\'s ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?\".[127]  After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.\\n\\nX-ray experimentation\\nX-ray Tesla took of his hand\\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments[128] (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-rays\"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen\\'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.[129]\\nIn March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen\\'s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography),[130] Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high-energy single-terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will\\xa0... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".[131]\\nTesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.[132][133]\\nOn 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:[134]\\n\\nTesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his \"electric gun\", Tesla said, \"The particles in the beam of force\\xa0... will travel much faster than such particles\\xa0... and they will travel in concentrations\".'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out.

It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\\nAt the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect.[139][140][d] Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile.[142] Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of \"invisible light\" would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming \"hopelessly lost\".[143]\\nBy the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab.[144][145][146] Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth\\'s atmosphere was conductive,[147][148] he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100\\xa0m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.\\n\\nColorado Springs\\nSee also: Tesla Experimental Station; Magnifying transmitter; and Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900\\nTesla\\'s Colorado Springs laboratory\\nTo further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.[149][150][151][152]  There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Electric Light Company to supply alternating current free of charge.[152] To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,662,400 in today\\'s dollars[76]) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.[153] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.[154]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='A multiple exposure picture of Tesla sitting next to his \"magnifying transmitter\" generating millions of volts. The 7-metre (23\\xa0ft) long arcs were not part of the normal operation, but only produced for effect by rapidly cycling the power switch.[155]\\nThere, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet (41\\xa0m) in length,[156] and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage.[157] The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to (incorrectly) conclude[158][159] that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.\\nDuring his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899[160] and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900.[161][162] Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars.[161] He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier\\'s Weekly article entitled \"Talking With Planets\", where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets.[162] It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi\\'s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado[162]—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.[163][unreliable source?]\\nTesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work,[164] illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.\\n\\nWardenclyffe\\nMain article: Wardenclyffe Tower\\nTesla\\'s Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904. From this facility, Tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless transmission of electrical energy across the Atlantic.\\nTesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria\\'s Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico\\'s.[165] In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($5,493,600 in today\\'s dollars[76]) from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161\\xa0km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.[166]\\nBy July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi\\'s radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own.[161] He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds.[163][unreliable source?] In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi\\'s success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\".[161] Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of 187 feet (57\\xa0m).[163][unreliable source?] In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.[166]\\nInvestors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi\\'s system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla\\'s project, claiming it was a hoax.[167] The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla\\'s part.[168] Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually amounted to $20,000 ($608,400 in today\\'s dollars[76]).[169] He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Later years\\nAfter Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan\\'s son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.[170]\\n\\nBladeless turbine\\nMain article: Tesla turbine\\nTesla\\'s bladeless turbine design\\nOn his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000\\xa0rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000\\xa0hp.[171] Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers.[172][173] He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device.[174][page\\xa0needed] Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.[175]\\n\\nWireless lawsuits\\nWhen World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement.[176] Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.[176][177]\\nIn 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi\\'s initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents.[140][178][179] Tesla\\'s 1915 case went nowhere,[180] but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla.[181] The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi\\'s claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi\\'s claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.[140][182]\\n\\nNobel Prize rumors\\nOn 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg \"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\".[183][184][185] There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize.[183] The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.[183]\\nThere have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other\\'s achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.[17][183]\\nIn the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel prize (although Edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937).[186]\\n\\nOther awards, patents and ideas\\nTesla won numerous medals and awards over this time.

These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel.[193] He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.[194]\\nTesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted \"a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,\" wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, \"saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or \\'bath.\\'\"[195] The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.[195]\\nBefore World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.\\nIn the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar).[196] Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high-frequency radio waves would penetrate water.[197] Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France\\'s first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla\\'s general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, \"(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly\".[198]\\nIn 1928, Tesla received patent, U.S. patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), which \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.[199] This impractical design was something Tesla thought would sell for less than $1,000.[200][201]\\nTesla had a further office at 350 Madison Ave[202] but by 1928 he no longer had a laboratory or funding.[201]\\n\\nLiving circumstances\\nTesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill.[203] He moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.[204][205]\\nTesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health.[205][206][207] He said that he had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. He spent over $2,000 (equivalent to $36,410 in 2023) to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed.[208] Tesla stated:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years.

As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.[209]\\nTesla\\'s unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934.[205] At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.[210]\\nTesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 (equivalent to $2,850 in 2023) per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living.[211][212][213][214] The payment has been described as being couched as a \"consulting fee\" to get around Tesla\\'s aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of \"unspecified settlement\".[213]\\n\\nBirthday press conferences\\nTesla on Time magazine commemorating his 75th birthday\\nIn 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor\\'s 75th birthday.[215] Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein,[216] and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine.[217] The cover caption \"All the world\\'s his power house\" noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims.[218][219]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Newspaper representation of the thought camera Tesla described at his 1933 birthday party\\nAt the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.[219]\\nIn 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was \"violently opposed\" to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.[220]\\nAt the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war.[221][222] He called it \"teleforce\", but was usually referred to as his death ray.[223] In 1940, the New York Times gave a range for the ray of 250 miles (400\\xa0km), with an expected development cost of US$2\\xa0million (equivalent to $43.5\\xa0million in 2023).[224] Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade.[225] The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion).[219][226] Tesla tried to attract interest of the US War Department,[227] United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.[228]\\nIn 1935, at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator.[229] Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898.[229] He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 pounds (2.3\\xa0kg) of air pressure.[230] He also proposed using his oscillators to transmit vibrations into the ground. He claimed it would work over any distance and could be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits, a technique he called \"telegeodynamics\".[134]\\nIn 1937, at his Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated: \"But it is not an experiment\\xa0... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.\"[219]\\n\\nDeath\\nRoom 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker, where Tesla died\\nCommemorative plaque, New Yorker Hotel\\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was struck by a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.[231][232]\\nOn 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla\\'s room, ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a type of heart attack).\\nTwo days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla\\'s belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items. After a three-day investigation, Trump\\'s report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='His [Tesla\\'s] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.[233]\\nIn a box purported to contain a part of Tesla\\'s \"death ray\", Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.[234]\\nOn 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over WNYC radio while violin pieces \"Ave Maria\" and \"Tamo daleko\" were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla\\'s body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today\\'s Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava) in New York City.\\n\\nPersonal life and character\\nTesla c.\\u20091896\\nTesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.[235] In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"Now the soft-voiced gentlewoman of my reverent worship has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions...\"[210] Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work,[208] Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.\\nTesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work.[136][236][237] However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force\".[238] His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul\".[239] Tesla\\'s friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink\".[240]\\nTesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson,[241] Stanford White,[242] Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey.[243][244][245] In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.[241] Twain notably described Tesla\\'s induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone\".[246] At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology.[247][248] The meeting with Swami Vivekananda stimulated Tesla\\'s interest in Eastern Science, which led to Tesla studying Hindu and Vedic philosophy for a number of years.[249] Tesla later wrote an article titled \"Man\\'s Greatest Achievement\" using Sanskrit terms akasha and prana to describe the relationship between matter and energy.[250][251] In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.[252][253]\\nTesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.[254] He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.[235] When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison\\'s life:\\n\\nHe had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene\\xa0... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor\\'s instinct and practical American sense.[255][256]\\nTesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.[222][257]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Views and beliefs\\nTesla c. 1885\\nOn experimental and theoretical physics\\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity.[258][259] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.[260]\\nTesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.[261] He was also critical of Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, saying:\\n\\nI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.[262]\\nIn 1935 he described relativity as \"a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king\" and said his own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty times the speed of light.[263]\\nTesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892,[261] and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\". He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.[264] Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.[265]\\n\\nOn society\\nThis article is part of a series on theEugenics Movement\\nHistorical trajectory\\nAncient\\nJus trium liberorum\\nLex Papia Poppaea\\nJewish views on incest\\nIncest in the Bible\\nMalthusian League\\nEugenic feminism\\nNazi eugenics\\nLaw for the Prevention of HereditarilyDiseased Offspring\\nHereditary Health Courts\\n\"Racial hygiene\"\\nLebensborn\\nRomani Holocaust\\nDoctors\\' Trial\\nUS eugenics\\nSlave breeding in the US\\nEugenics Survey of Vermont\\nOneida stirpiculture\\nImmigration Act of 1924\\nSterilization law in the United States\\nBuck v.

Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:\\n\\n...\\xa0man\\'s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct\\xa0... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.[268]\\nIn 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity\\'s future would be run by \"Queen Bees\". He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.[269]\\nTesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article entitled \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" (20 December 1914).[270] Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.[30][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n\\nOn religion\\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\"[271] He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call \\'soul\\' or \\'spirit,\\' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the \\'soul\\' or the \\'spirit\\' ceases likewise.\"[271]\\n\\nLiterary works\\nTesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals.[272] Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.\\nMany of Tesla\\'s writings are freely available online,[273] including the article \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", published in The Century Magazine in 1900,[274] and the article \"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency\", published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.[275][276]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Nikola Tesla - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Legacy and honors\\nSee also: Nikola Tesla in popular culture, List of things named after Nikola Tesla, and List of Nikola Tesla patents\\nGilded urn with Tesla\\'s ashes, in his favorite geometric object, a sphere (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade)\\nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla\\'s nephew, influential Yugoslav politician Sava Kosanović\\xa0[sr], Tesla\\'s entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanović\\'s secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla\\'s ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.[277]\\nTesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.[278] Some of Tesla\\'s patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents[278] issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla\\'s patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.[279] Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.[citation needed]\\n\\nSee also\\nAtmospheric electricity\\xa0– Electricity in planetary atmospheres\\nMichael Faraday\\xa0– English physicist and chemist (1791–1867)\\nCharles Proteus Steinmetz\\xa0– American mathematician and electrical engineer (1865–1923)\\nTelluric current\\xa0– Natural electric current in the Earth\\'s crust\\nNotes\\nFootnotes\\n\\n^ Tesla does not mention which professor this was by name, but some sources conclude this was Martin Sekulić.[23][24]\\n\\n^ Tesla\\'s contemporaries remembered that on a previous occasion Machine Works manager Batchelor had been unwilling to give Tesla a $7 a week pay raise [55]\\n\\n^ Account comes from a letter Tesla sent in 1938 on the occasion of receiving an award from the National Institute of Immigrant Welfare[63]\\n\\n^ Tesla\\'s own experiments led him to erroneously believe Hertz had misidentified a form of conduction instead of a new form of electromagnetic radiation, an incorrect assumption that Tesla held for a couple of decades.[140][141]\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n^ \"Tesla\" Archived 24 October 2021 at the Wayback Machine.

It is dedicated to honoring and displaying the life and work of Nikola Tesla as well as the final resting place for Tesla. It holds more than 160,000 original documents, over 2,000 books and journals, over 1,200 historical technical exhibits, over 1,500 photographs and photo plates of original, technical objects, instruments and apparatus, and over 1,000 plans and drawings. Very little is on display in the small ground floor exhibition space.\\nThe Nikola Tesla Archive was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003 due to its critical role regarding history of electrification of the world and future technological advancements in this area.[2]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nThe Nikola Tesla Museum is housed in a residential villa built in 1927 according to the designs of Dragiša Brašovan, a distinguished Serbian architect. The building was used for various purposes until December 5, 1952, when the Nikola Tesla Museum was founded in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Certain items for the museum were shipped from New York City to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on September 7, 1951, as a result of efforts by Sava Kosanović, Tesla's nephew and closest relative[3] and his attorney Philip Wittenberg.\\n\\nExhibitions[edit]\\nThe permanent exhibition was arranged in 1955. It consists of four rooms on the ground floor. From time to time there have been some modifications, but for many years the basic concept has remained the same. Its first part is primarily a memorial exhibition, while the second part is an interactive one, with 3D computer generated models of Tesla's inventions. From time to time, the museum organizes thematic exhibitions of documents, photographs and other material in order to display some periods from Tesla's inventive life.\\n\\nReconstruction[edit]\\nReconstruction of the Nikola Tesla Museum started on November 3, 2006. The first phase of the project was scheduled to have been complete by the end of 2006. The garden on the roof of the museum was designed to be enclosed by glass windows, which would turn the roof into a computer room. This reconstruction is now complete, and the museum is available to visit.[4]\\n\\nGallery[edit]\\n\\nBaptismal record of Nikola Tesla, c. 24 July 1856.\\n\\n A copy of the two phase induction motor from 1887.

It is dedicated to Tesla, who  was born in 1856 in his Serb parents house in Smiljan, then part of the Kingdom of Croatia within the Austrian Empire. The young engineer later left his homeland to work in America. The Lika Museum in nearby Gospić administers the site.\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\nThe Memorial Center was opened to the public on the 150th anniversary of Tesla\\'s birthday, 10 July 2006, by the President of the Republic of Croatia.[2] The original memorial site was first established as a museum in 1956, but it was damaged during the Croatian War of Independence when a projectile fell on the commercial building next to Nikola Tesla\\'s house. The fire was eventually put out by the Croatian Army who deposited furniture and other objects it saved in the Museum of Lika.[3] The Croatian authorities restored the complex and reopened it in a 2006 ceremony, with the highest dignitaries of Croatia and Serbia attending.[4] After the war it was renovated, improved, equipped and opened as Memorial Center in 2006.\\n\\nArchitecture and exhibits[edit]\\nOn its surface area of 1.37 square kilometres, the memorial complex contains various components: museum in the birth house[5] of Nikola Tesla (where the details of his life are shown in a permanent exhibition of artifacts, documents, photographs and audiovisual material), the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Peter and Paul, an old agricultural building, village cemetery, Tesla\\'s testing station, stone monuments, benches and river banks designed by architect Zdenko Kolacio, metal statue of Nikola Tesla made by sculptor Mile Blažević, open-air auditorium, prototypes of some Tesla\\'s inventions[6] (induction motor, Tesla\\'s turbine, rotating magnetic field, Tesla coil), multimedia center etc.\\nVarious scientific and educational activities or presentations are occasionally organized in the Memorial Center. Over the past years the number of visitors coming to the site has been steadily growing. 41,000 tourists from many countries from all over the world visited the center in 2016.[7] In 2018 this number increased to over 44,000 people.\\n\\nGallery[edit]\\n\\nMemorial Center reception building\\n\\nTourists visiting Memorial Center\\n\\nTesla\\'s birth house entrance\\n\\nBuildings and surrounding area\\n\\nTesla\\'s experimental station\\n\\nTesla coil\\n\\nMultimedia center\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nList of museums in Croatia\\nTesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe\\nNikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade, Serbia\\nList of science museums\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"Posjećenost hrvatskih muzeja u 2017. godini\" (PDF). mdc.hr (in Croatian).

Vesna Bunčić, ravnateljica Muzeja Like u kojem se čuvaju namještaj i predmeti iz Tesline rodne kuće. Kada je u svibnju 1992. jedan projektil pao na gospodarski objekt tik uz kuću, izbio je požar u kojem je ta drvena zgradica u potpunosti izgorjela. No, požar je zahvatio i dio krova Tesline rodne kuće. – Pripadnici HV-a ugasili su požar, a onda su namještaj i svi predmeti deponirani u Muzeju Like. Od 2000. godine Muzej Like krenuo je u sanaciju krova, dok je gospodarski objekt ponovno sagrađen 2003. godine – pojasnila je Vesna Bunčić. U Muzeju su, uz namještaj, i porculanski predmeti te 133 knjige iz biblioteke Teslina oca Milutina. Namještaj će tu i ostati jer se u obnovljenoj Teslinoj kući sada priprema drukčiji postav.\\n\\n^ \"150. obljetnica rođenja Nikole Tesle\" [150th anniversary of the birth of Nikola Tesla] (in Croatian).

It was written by Nina Metivier, and directed by Nida Manzoor.\\nIn 1903, the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) helps Nikola Tesla (Goran Višnjić) escape from being kidnapped by the Skithra aliens, along with the assistance of her companions Graham O\\'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill).\\nThe episode was watched by 5.20 million viewers, and received generally positive reviews from critics.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla%27s_Night_of_Terror', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': \"Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror - Wikipedia\", 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Plot[edit]\\nWardenclyffe Tower in 1904\\nAt Niagara Falls in 1903, Nikola Tesla is unsuccessful in getting investors for his wireless power transmission system as it is seen as dangerous and crazy. After working late fixing his generator, he comes across a floating orb. Feeling endangered, he makes a run with his assistant, Dorothy Skerritt, as a cloaked figure shoots at them. The Doctor arrives in time to help them escape aboard a train headed to New York City, ditching their pursuer by detaching the carriage.\\nIn New York, the group finds protesters waiting outside Tesla\\'s lab, having been goaded into fearing Tesla and his inventions by his competitor Thomas Edison. The Doctor identifies the orb as an Orb of Thassa designed to share knowledge, but repurposed for an unknown cause. After spotting a spy for Edison, the Doctor, Graham and Ryan visit Edison\\'s workshop, suspecting him to be behind the attack on Tesla. The cloaked figure arrives at Edison\\'s lab and fatally electrocutes everyone in the workshop before pursuing Edison. The group escapes and traps one of the creatures in a chemical ring of fire, but it escapes by teleportation. The Doctor tries to warn Tesla and Yaz back at his lab, but the two are captured and transported to an invisible alien ship above the city. The Queen of the Skithra demands they fix her ship. When Tesla refuses, the Queen threatens to kill Yaz, but the Doctor transports herself onto the ship just in time. She learns that the Skithra ship is just a collection of stolen parts from various species and the Skithra just use others to do their work for them. The Skithra also chose Tesla as their \"engineer\" because he was able to discover their signal while he had been working on his wireless power system.\\nThe Doctor transports herself, Tesla, and Yaz back to Tesla\\'s Wardenclyffe lab. The Doctor warns the Queen to leave, but the Queen refuses, threatening to destroy Earth if Tesla is not handed over. While Tesla and the Doctor hook up the TARDIS to help power Tesla\\'s Wardenclyffe Tower, Graham, Ryan, Yaz, Dorothy and Edison ward off the invading scorpion-like Skithra. The Tower activates, and electrical bolts shoot through the Skithra ship, forcing it to leave Earth. Yaz is disappointed that despite Tesla\\'s heroics, his reputation in the future remained unchanged, but the Doctor reminds her that Tesla\\'s vision for a wireless world will still come to pass.\\n\\nProduction[edit]\\nDevelopment[edit]\\n\"Nikola Tesla\\'s Night of Terror\" was written by Nina Metivier, who had worked as a script editor on the previous series.[1][2]\\n\\nCasting[edit]\\nRobert Glenister and Goran Višnjić were cast,[3] as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla respectively.[4] Glenister previously appeared on Doctor Who as the android Salateen in the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani.[5] Anjli Mohindra, who had previously portrayed Rani Chandra in the Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures, played Queen Skithra.[6][2] Further cast members were announced in Doctor Who Magazine #547 in early January 2020.[2]\\n\\nFilming[edit]\\nNida Manzoor directed the third block, consisting of the fourth and fifth episodes.[7][2] The sets for 1903 New York City were located at Nu Boyana Film Studios in Sofia, Bulgaria.[8]\\n\\nPromotion[edit]\\nThe trailer for the episode was released after the broadcast of the previous episode, \"Orphan 55\".[9]\\n\\nBroadcast and reception[edit]\\nProfessional ratingsAggregate scoresSourceRatingRotten Tomatoes (Tomatometer)89%[10]Rotten Tomatoes (Average Score)7/10[10]Review scoresSourceRatingThe A.V.

Most of the Sanctuary team are abnormals, despite looking human: Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) has longevity, John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Ashley Magnus (Emilie Ullerup) can teleport, and Henry Foss (Ryan Robbins) is a werewolf. Even Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) was twice turned to an abnormal temporarily: firstly in the episode \"Warriors\", then later in the episode \"Metamorphosis\". Several of the actors who play their respective characters have been nominated for Leo and Constellation Awards.\\n\\nMain characters[edit]\\nHelen Magnus[edit]\\nMain article: Helen Magnus\\nDoctor Helen Magnus, played by Amanda Tapping is a 274-year-old teratologist (born August 27, 1850, and sent back in time 113 years.[1]) and head of the Sanctuary in Old City. She was born in England during the Victorian era, and was one of the first female doctors and scientists of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. Her father, Gregory Magnus, taught her about his private research of studying and helping the Abnormals.[2] She later builds the Sanctuary Network in Old City using her father\\'s designs to accommodate the Abnormals. On one hunt, she saves Will Zimmerman during his childhood from a deadly Abnormal, though she is unable to rescue his mother. Decades later, she recruits Will as her protege.[3]\\n\\nWill Zimmerman[edit]\\nMain article: Will Zimmerman\\nDoctor Will Zimmerman, played by Robin Dunne is a police forensic psychiatrist, who possesses natural empathic abilities and a sense of perception. This trait leaves him unpopular with his bosses, and he is often ridiculed or ignored for theories that are \"out of the box\". Sometime before the series, his girlfriend, Meg (Kandyse McClure) breaks up with him. Will secretly suffers nightmares due to an encounter with an Abnormal that left his mother dead.[3] While investigating the mysterious deaths of two local police officers, Will is confronted and eventually recruited by Helen Magnus to help treat her patients (specifically those who are difficult to reach emotionally and need to be convinced to trust her). Though highly skeptical of things that science cannot explain, he learns to accept all things extraordinary. He spends his time in the series on his travels with Magnus and the rest of the Sanctuary crew.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Ashley Magnus[edit]\\nAshley Magnus, played by Emilie Ullerup (webisodes & seasons 1–2) is the daughter of Helen Magnus and John Druitt. After her conception, Helen kept the frozen embryo for over a century. When she could no longer bear the loneliness from her longevity and from losing Druitt,[3] though she is at first unaware of it, she retrieves the embryo. Despite what Ashley lacks in behavioral skills, she more than makes up for it as an expert monster hunter, becoming proficient in using advanced weaponry and technology. Ashley is quite close to her mother and provides a counterbalance to Helen\\'s desire to protect Abnormals, as she normally doesn\\'t hesitate in terminating hostile ones and using whatever methods necessary to capture targets. She is on good terms with Sylvio (known as Ernie in the Web series) and his men, though Helen thinks otherwise. In \"The Five\", she learns that Druitt is her father (she was made aware of it in the fourth Webisode),[4] and eventually comes to accept it.[5]\\nIn the Season 1 finale \"Revelations\", Ashley and Henry Foss break into a Cabal weapons facility to retrieve the files relating to \"Lazarus\", the weapon used to turn Abnormals on Humans, but are captured by the Cabal, who drug her and turn her into an Abnormal, inheriting her father\\'s teleportation abilities. After the two escape, she is forced by Dana Whitcomb who now controls her to steal the vial of Vampire-blood taken by the team to cure the weapon, and escapes to the Cabal facility on Easter Island, where she is formally welcomed to The Cabal.[6] In the season 2 premiere \"End of Nights\", the Cabal use the Vampire-blood to convert her into a Vampire-hybrid, which apparently destroys her personality. They then use her DNA to create five more hybrids, who start taking down the Sanctuary network. During an attack against the Old City facility, Ashley reasserts her original personality long enough to save her mother, apparently killing herself in the process by teleporting while the EM shield is up with the last hybrid.[7] Magnus believes Ashley survives, but her searches are fruitless, Magnus is forced to accept that she is gone.[8]\\n\\nBigfoot[edit]\\n\"Bigfoot\",[9] also known as big guy or biggie, played by Christopher Heyerdahl, who also plays John Druitt is an intelligent Neanderthal-like species, and a former patient of Dr. Magnus. Before he met Magnus, he liked to scare children.[10] Magnus retrieved him (over fifty years ago) and has said to have removed \"more than a few bullets\" from him, and when he refused to leave her, she appointed him a place in her staff, where he mostly acts as a butler, chauffeur, body guard and general handy man.[3] He is allergic to flowers. He admits to Will Zimmerman that he once scared him for fun during his childhood.[10] Though he does appear to be afraid of him at first, Will grows to respect and befriend him. In the season 1 finale, he becomes infected with the Cabal bioweapon designed to turn abnormals against humans, and is confined to a cell, with the team hoping that a vial of Vampire blood used to try to stop the weapon would reverse his rampage.[6] In the season 2 premiere, Bigfoot refuses to take the cure Tesla has developed, because taking anything made by humans would be against his people\\'s beliefs, even though he is already an outcast to them. However, he eventually takes the serum to help his friends battle the Vampire-hybrids, after some persuasion by Magnus.[7]\\nThroughout the series, Bigfoot uses the caveman-like \"ack, ack\" expression. According to Damian Kindler, Heyerdahl invented it for his character. The expression has made an effect on the crew, who also sometimes uses the impression while on break as communicating each other.[11]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Henry Foss[edit]\\nRyan Robbins plays Henry Foss\\nHenry Foss (referred to as Hank by Kate Freelander), played by Ryan Robbins (seasons 2–4; recurring webisodes and season 1) was found on the Moors as a child by Helen Magnus. (In the webisodes, however, he is the descendant of Gregory Magnus\\' first weaponsmith.) He is a friend of Ashley and of Bigfoot. He is a self-proclaimed geek in computer science, as well as a weapons designer, including the construction of a short-wave sonic weapon,[12] and often supplies new gear to Ashley for missions, as well as regularly maintaining Sanctuary\\'s defenses such as an EM shield, keeping them working just as well.[3] Like many among the Sanctuary, he is an Abnormal, a werewolf (a class nine hyper-accelerated protean life form or HAP). He took diazepam to suppress his werewolf abilities, but quit the drug upon realizing that his abilities are controllable.[4] He considered surgery from Helen to rid his werewolf side, but ultimately chose to not undergo the surgery.[5] He can transform at will. Until recently, he has been unable to find or communicate with other HAPs. He investigated a werewolf sighting in Northern England and was able to locate a group of HAPs living in a restricted sanitarium and taking medication to suppress their werewolf transformations, believing they will become uncontrolled monsters. He shows them otherwise and begins a romantic relationship with one of them, Erica. His ability has proven useful, including an incident where he is able to harness his power and escape from the Cabal, who plan to turn him into a werewolf permanently.[6]\\nActor Ryan Robbins described his role as \"by far the easiest to work on\", compared to his other prominent roles in television, including Ladon Radim in Stargate Atlantis, and Charlie Connor in Battlestar Galactica.[13] Foss was a recurring character in Season 1, but was upgraded to a main character for Season 2.[14] For his role as Henry Foss in \"Edward\", Ryan Robbins won a Leo Award for \"Best Guest Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series\".[15]\\n\\nKate Freelander[edit]\\nKate Freelander, played by Agam Darshi (seasons 2–3; recurring season 4) is a con-artist with Cabal connection and has a vast knowledge of their tactics and movements. She was born in Mombai but raised in Chicago, and left after her father (who was a safecracker for a gang) was murdered by Jimmy, a former gang member who later assists Magnus.[16] She first appears in the second-season premiere, \"End of Nights\". She reluctantly switches sides to the Sanctuary after she is head hunted by the Cabal, and assists them combating the Vampire-hybrids.[7] She becomes a member of the Sanctuary, taking over Ashley\\'s duties, and helps recapture an Abnormal she accidentally released that now thinks she is its mother.[8] In an alternate future, she and Will had a son named Magnus Zimmerman, though being in the probable future, their relationship never took place. However she expresses by far the most concern for Will during his disappearance suggesting she has feelings for him.[17]  When Will is brought to the edge of death to contact Kali, Kate shows great concern for him, telling him he will return and doesn\\'t give up on him, even when he\\'s apparently gone and is visibly relieved when he returns to life. She also shows great concern for Will in Metamorphosis, and several times appears about to tell him something and then turning away. She is absent for much of season four, having agreed to go underground to help the Hollow Earth Abnormals as they attempt to rebuild their society. This decision is heavily influenced by her blossoming romance with Garris, one of their leaders.[18]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Recurring characters[edit]\\nJohn Druitt[edit]\\nFor the actual Jack the Ripper suspect of the same name, see Montague John Druitt.\\nChristopher Heyerdahl plays \"Bigfoot\" and John Druitt\\nMontague John Druitt,[19] played by Christopher Heyerdahl (Webisodes, recurring) is the primary antagonist of the opening webisodes and TV pilot. He is a member of \"The Five\" during the Victorian era and Helen\\'s former lover.[20] As a member of \"The Five\", he has the ability to teleport at will.[10] However, in one instance, he was taken host by an energy creature, which drives him into homicidal behaviour, and becomes Jack the Ripper, murdering eight prostitutes.[3][21] He reappears in \"Sanctuary for All\", where he allows himself to be captured by his daughter, Ashley and brought to the Sanctuary to confront Helen, since he is dying. He sabotages the Sanctuary\\'s defenses and uses his power to put Ashley\\'s life in danger to force Helen to give him her blood, which he says she gave him to save his life once before. She acquiesces, but gives him a poisoned sample; his body becomes unstable and he teleports out.[3] In \"The Five\", he is revealed to have been revived by fellow \"Five\" member, Nikola Tesla. When Druitt refuses to join his cause, Tesla tortures him, but that apparently either weakens or otherwise disables the energy creature, and abates his violent tendencies. He escapes and captures Ashley, in order for her to help him save Magnus from Tesla, who he believes is set to kill her. He convinces Ashley, and they rescue Magnus from Tesla and the Cabal in Rome.[4]\\nHe returns again in \"Revelations\" to aid the Sanctuary team in stopping the Cabal from bringing about a war between humans and Abnormals with the biological weapon \"Lazarus\". Aided with other members of the \"Five\", the group successfully retrieves the vial of pure vampire blood needed to find a cure for the weapon. However, in the end, the vial is stolen by Ashley, who defects to the Cabal, by whom she was brainwashed previously.[6] After his daughter is apparently killed, he teams up with Tesla and manages to take down several Cabal cells.[8] After returning to the Sanctuary, he reverts to a psychotic murderer, due to the energy creature reasserting itself. The energy creature is released, and locks down the building to kill everyone inside. Druitt saves everybody by teleporting to the same area as the creature, allowing it to take him host again, and then teleporting away.[21] In season 3, Helen tracked him down in the Philippines, as she needed his help to get to her father\\'s mystery city. He was still unstable, but slightly less murderous than before, and so proved immensely helpful in the quest. As part of a larger plot, Adam Worth deceived him, and Druitt was violently tortured. Their next encounter was quite bloody. However, Worth managed to convince Druitt to let him live in exchange for a chance to travel back in time and prevent himself from gaining his powers and madness. Worth broke his word and so Druitt teamed up with Magnus in an attempt to stop him. This required Druitt to absorb large amounts of energy, strengthening his violent parasite and having an unknown effect on his sanity.\\nWhen Christopher Heyerdahl was offered a role in the web series, he read several characters and got interested in Druitt, immediately admiring the character. He was surprised yet elated that he got the part of Druitt.[22] Jason Hughes of TV Squad said that Heyerdahl has done a good job at playing sinister, and that the actor fits the stereotype for tall, pale and bald antagonists.[23] For his role as Druitt in \"Revelations (Part 2)\", Christopher Heyerdahl was nominated for a Leo Award for \"Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series\".[24]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Nikola Tesla[edit]\\nFor the real life electrical engineer on whom the character is based, see Nikola Tesla.\\nNikola Tesla, played by Jonathon Young (recurring) is a member of the Five, where the vampire blood he was injected with activated his dormant Vampiric genes, resulting in him becoming part-vampire, as well as gaining the ability to control electricity.[4] He also has a taste for expensive wine.[7] He despises humanity for destroying the pure-blooded vampires centuries ago. Tesla eventually leaves the Five and goes underground for over 60 years to resurrect his vampiric ancestors. He attempts to get John Druitt to join him, but John refuses. Tesla responds by torturing him, though this unwittingly restores Druitt\\'s sanity. Tesla wants Helen to join him also, but she refuses, even after he kills and resurrects the Cabal members who are hunting them. He is seemingly killed by Druitt before Tesla can kill her.[4] He later regenerates and returns alone to Bhalasaam, the lost city which housed the last of the vampires. He reluctantly joins the rest of the Five in undergoing various trials to gain a vial of vampire blood needed to stop the Cabal\\'s bioweapon Lazarus. In his trial, he is forced to endure a severe electrical charge.[6]\\nIn the second season, he develops a cure for the Lazarus virus and a weapon to neutralise the powers of Vampire-hybrids, who attempt to take down the Sanctuary network.[7] He later aids Druitt in taking down several Cabal cells.[8] Later, Tesla opens a clinic in Mexico, which he uses to infect wealthy drug-addicted teenagers with a treatment that will slowly change them into Vampires in 30 years, after they inherit positions of power from their parents, effectively creating a new vampire age of enlightenment (in Sanctuary, Vampires are responsible for the age of enlightenment before they were driven extinct by humanity at the dawn of The Dark Ages). However, he overlooks the possibility that they may die within the 30-year development. One of his patients dies and subsequently resurrects in a car crash, only to kill all of his friends from the clinic, thereby activating the vampire genes and resurrecting them as well. Tesla teams up with the Sanctuary to reverse the transformation, but loses his own Vampiric powers by accident. He then decides to continue in his efforts to take over the world and also discovers that he now has the ability to control magnetism instead of electricity.[25]\\nIn Season 3, Nikola sends an SOS call to the sanctuary team from the mountains of Colombia where he finds a mutated centipede in an abandoned Cabal research facility that could contain traces of source blood required to become a vampire once again. After Helen rescues Tesla, he and Magnus start deciphering the clues of the map of the underground city of Praxis that Gregory Magnus sent to Helen. To apologize for leaving him at the Sanctuary during the expedition to the city, Magnus takes him to a former Praxian stronghold, where he regains his vampiric abilities from the blood of a surviving vampire queen kept in stasis and loses his reverence for his ancestors when she expresses the desire to enslave the human race. Magnus and Tesla trick her into attempting to read the map of Praxis while they escape the stronghold, and the queen is killed when the vampire failsafe in the Praxian technology destroys the entire complex.\\nIn the fourth season, Magnus discovers that Tesla has been appointed the head of SCIU, the U.S. government\\'s anti-abnormal task force, headquartered at Area 51, in the southeastern desert (the one in Roswell is apparently a decoy), where Tesla defrauds the US government out of research funding intended for an Abnormal final solution, instead focusing on his own pursuits of inventing wireless, limitless electricity from the radiation of the temporal rift. While Magnus is furious with Tesla over assisting the SCIU, he makes amends by sending her the blueprints of the facility. Shortly afterward, he is inevitably fired from SCIU when they discover he is using the research money for his personal science projects. For the remainder of the season he assists the Sanctuary in their stand against an abnormal terrorist cell.\\nJonathon Young plays Tesla during a theatrical tour from \"The Electric Company\", as well as win festivals with it.[13] For his role as Nikola Tesla, Young received a 2009 Leo Award nomination for \"Best Guest Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series\", along with Ryan Robbins; the latter won the award.[24]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='James Watson[edit]\\nFor the fictional character on whom the character is based, see Dr. Watson.\\nPeter Wingfield plays James Watson\\nJames Watson, played by Peter Wingfield (seasons 1 & 3–4) is a member of \"The Five\", who displays great intelligence, enough to build a powered exoskeleton to keep him alive for over a century. Like other members of the Five, Watson is an allusion to a historical figure. The in-universe story is that Arthur Conan Doyle patterned Sherlock Holmes\\' deductive genius on Watson. However, out of respect of Watson\\'s privacy, Conan Doyle created the \"Holmes\" pseudonym for the detective, and named the sidekick \"Watson\".\\nHe was the head of the UK Sanctuary. He had a friendship with John Druitt, until he realized that Druitt was Jack the Ripper, the man he wanted to investigate and capture. This led to him seemingly hating Druitt more than any other member of \"The Five\". Druitt also appeared to be more upset with the loss of Watson\\'s friendship than any other member of \"The Five\", indicating how close they once were. Currently, it appears that he only remained close to Magnus. In \"Revelations\" he assists the rest of the Five to acquire a vial of vampire blood to stop the Cabal, who plans to launch the bioweapon \"Lazarus\" to infect the abnormals and turn them against humans. They retrieve the vial through tests, one testing his intelligence. This test also helped restore the friendship he and Druitt once had. However, by the time they retrieve the vial, his exoskeleton fails, and Watson ages over 100 years in mere minutes. Before he dies, he tells Will to think of what they missed, since the retrieval seemed too easy.[6]\\n\\nJoe Kavanaugh[edit]\\nKavan Smith plays Joe Kavanaugh\\nJoe Kavanaugh, played by Kavan Smith (webisodes & season 1) is a Detective for the Old City Police Department. He seems unappreciative of Zimmerman\\'s work, and rejects his theories in certain crime scenes.[3] However, after Zimmerman leaves to join the Sanctuary, Kavanaugh occasionally finds himself asking Zimmerman\\'s opinion with other unusual cases, including one incident in \"Edward\", and with time gains respect for Zimmerman\\'s talents and beliefs.[5]\\n\\nClara Griffin[edit]\\nClara Griffin, played by Christine Chatelain (recurring Season 1–2) is the granddaughter of Nigel Griffin (Vincent Gale), who was a member of \"The Five\". She had inherited the power of invisibility. His powers were passed on to his daughter, and to Clara after he dies of natural causes. The Sanctuary finds her in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she reluctantly joins the team to stop the Cabal\\'s \"Lazarus\" bioweapon. She uses her invisibility powers to gather a key to acquire a vial of vampire blood to stop Lazarus, though it is later stolen by Ashley who defects to the Cabal.[6] In Season 2 she has a relationship with Will.[26] However, she is killed by Super Abnormals, who are able to see through her invisibility.[7]\\n\\nDana Whitcomb[edit]\\nDana Whitcomb, played by Lynda Boyd (recurring Season 1–2), is the director of Operations and Logistics in the Cabal, and oversees several of their operations, including the Lazarus virus[6] and the conversion of Ashley Magnus into a Super Abnormal.[7] After the Sanctuary defeat the Cabal in the beginning of the second season, Whitcomb goes on the run. However, Druitt is able to track her down, though her fate is unknown.[8]\\n\\nTerrance Wexford[edit]\\nPaul McGillion plays Wexford\\nTerrance Wexford, played by Paul McGillion (Webisodes, recurring Season 2–3) is an Abnormal and expert on ancient artifacts. He first appeared in the sixth webisode, informing Magnus the nature of The Morrígan.[27] His appearance was cut from \"Fata Morgana\" in the TV adaption. In the TV adaption, however, he is the leader of the New York Sanctuary. The Network appoints him in charge over Magnus once they learn that she kept alive \"Big Bertha\", apparently the most dangerous Abnormal on the Earth. He attempts to kill Big Bertha, but this only succeeds in angering her enough to cause a tsunami.[28] In the following episode, his crew discover Wexford is so determined to kill the Abnormal he is willing to kill Magnus if she is in the way. Because of his reckless command, Magnus eventually overrules him and retakes command of the Sanctuary Network.[29] In the next episode, because he broke several protocols, including firing at a passenger yacht, he is relieved of command from the New York Sanctuary.[30] Paul McGillion stated that Wexford is \"a lot more evil than I thought he would\\'ve been\", but added \"it\\'s a really fun character to play, it\\'s always fun playing villains\". Prosthetics and contact lenses were applied to McGillion to appear as the abnormal Wexford, though he would often have trouble seeing what he was doing whilst shooting scenes. McGillion has reprised his role as Wexford in the third season, where he would be \"heavily in the first two episodes\".[31]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla_(Sanctuary)', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'title': 'Characters of Sanctuary - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Declan MacRae[edit]\\nDeclan MacRae, played by Robert Lawrenson (recurring Season 2–4) is the head of the London Sanctuary, following the death of Watson.[7] After the base falls victim to the Vampire hybrids, he occasionally assists the Old City base in their operations.[32] In \"Veritas\", he takes temporary charge of the Sanctuary while Magnus is charged with murdering Bigfoot, until it is revealed Magnus did this to stop a member of the telepathic \"Triad\" whom she suspected for several years.[33] In Firewall, he along with Kate, Helen, Henry and Will captured a deadly Abnormal in Old City.\\nIn season 4, he leads a search party into the ruins of Praxtus, the underground city, to find Helen Magnus.  He and a committee name Will Zimmerman Head of the global Sanctuary network in Magnus\\'s absence.\\n\\nAdam Worth[edit]\\nAdam Worth, played by Ian Tracey (recurring Season 3–4) is a former acquaintance of The Five, who wanted to become one of them but was continually denied. Adam has a Jekyll and Hyde-type personality disorder, with Adam\\'s calm and peaceful persona alternating against the opposite characteristics of Hyde. The split occurred after his beloved daughter died of a disease he felt Magnus should have tried harder to cure, leading to his long-standing enmity. The Five were charged with hunting him down and killing him due to his murderous tendencies. Magnus shot him at the top of a cliff and he plummeted to the river below, but he did not die. Instead, he ended up in Praxis, which he nearly managed to destroy with his experiments in time dilation. He later used those experiments to capture and irradiate Magnus as part of a plot to get back to Praxis. When his initial attempt was thwarted, he manipulated hordes of disaffected subterranean Abnormals into providing a distraction while he finished work on his time machine, which successfully opened a portal to 1898. In the following episode titled \"Tempus\" Magnus kills Adam with an advanced weapon shortly after he fails to save his daughters life.\\n\\nTwo Faced Guy[edit]\\nTwo Faced Guy, played by Chuck Campbell (minor recurring Season 1–3) is an abnormal who appears normal from front on, but has a second face on the back of his head, the back headed face (played by Brad Proctor) being more abnormal looking. He is the most human of the abnormals, and  unlike the others, he has freedom of the sanctuary. He is sometimes seen helping with minor tasks, and is shown drinking with Big Guy in season three, discussing somewhat derisively how the human team members talk about their missions.\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n^ \"TV - redeyechicago.com\".
